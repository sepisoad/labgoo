Ah ah
I'll wait here, you're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should have never gone to Hollywood
They find you to time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should have never trusted Hollywood
I wrote you and told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should have never gone to Hollywood
